note that some of the data are in their native folder, one I re-created the folder to be parallel with the 
one already distributed (not sure it will be the exact name, especially since I’ve just seen from the output 
of the S6-VT meeting that a reprocessing will be done early next year. The production day/hour will be 
different in the file which will be distributed in the end). The last two (L2 files for the waveform 
notebook) are out of any folder (part of the idea of the new naming scheme, anyway).

This is awesome Vinca, thank you! Definitely not cheating to use some of the data that’s upcoming – 
that’s being prepared :) 
 
Could you put the example files on a google drive/dropbox or something? Just for ease when we test and 
integrate them in to git. If not, no worries, I can probably track down the files. 
 
Olly – I’ll put a first version on these on to git in the correct repository. We’ll need an overview notebook, 
and one on data access (though for S6 this is a bit tricky as it’s just FTP and data centre for 
now)…perhaps I best write those.
 
Vinca – I’ll come back to you with any questions once I’ve looked through in more detail.
 
Have a good weekend all!

Hi,
 
Please find attached a first draft for the S6 notebooks. 
Note that I cheated a bit – some data are not yet publicly available. With the data the notebook is much 
too big to be sent by e-mail, though. How do you want to proceed? 
 
Best regards,
Vinca

Dear both,
 
Thanks for your thoughts and for your collaboration on this!
 
@Hayley: Unfortunately I get a 404 “Page not found” when I click on the links you provided.
 
I will put the following in the next WPD:
Provide 3 Jupyer Notebooks on S6, following the example of the “learn-sral” modules provided on gitlab 
(https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eo-lab-usc-open/ocean/eumetsat_ocean_training).
I hope this is fine – let me know if not. We can still adjust it.
 
Thanks!
 
Cheers,
Christine

All sounds great Vinca. Agree the ‘nuts and bolts’ of the formats etc can be dull, but a really necessary 
place to start I think. We can look at more exciting things as we get more data and can come up with 
case studies etc :) 
 
Yes, definitely do emphasise the continuity – its been a key point of the S6 comms so that aligns nicely.

Hi,
 
For S6, the first point will be to adapt reading codes… they will be quite different with the use of groups 
in the netCDF files. Then there’s the parameters’ names and the flags which are different from S3, and 
even slightly from Jason-3. The fact that the waveforms are not anymore in the L2 “expanded” data, too. 
Not the most ‘enthusiasming’ points, I’m afraid, but necessary to users. 
 
As a rule, in S6 case I would tend to stress more the continuity (with Jason-3) than the differences (with 
S3) – the main objective of this mission is the continuity of measurements, for climate records in 
particular (but climate records are hard to demonstrate in a notebook). With improvements, sure. I’ll try 
to think about a way of mentioning both continuity and improvements somewhere in the notebooks. 
 
Cheers

Hi Vinca,
 
Thanks – it’s really helpful to have your thoughts on the learning objectives/narrative you had in mind :) 
I can definitely find a more suitable track that will support the examples. Will add to the issues list in git 
to be addressed in the coming months.
 
For S6 – did you have thoughts on adapting the notebooks to show some of the differences between the 
different altimeters? I was thinking with the waveforms one to have some comment on the interleaved 
mode etc? 
 
Cheers,
 
Hayley

Subject: RE: Jupyter Notebooks on S6 for training
 
Hi,
 
Thanks. 
OK for me. I’ll have a look at the first one, but will concentrate on notebooks 3-5.
 
Yes, the track one can be used with almost any track (ideally with a majority of ocean along, but that’s 
most of them), while the SLA or waveforms ones show each a given phenomenon.  
For the SLA, I’m almost always using the same track numbers (depending on the satellite, of course) from 
a recent cycle, going over either Gulf Stream or Kuroshio (the latest when I did training in Asia).  Any 
cycle can do, but some tracks are definitely more showy than others – the ones crossing a strong current, 
mostly. Could be Agulhas, ACC… too, of course.  
For the waveform one : either you only plot a waveform anywhere (over open ocean) and that’s it but it 
is making the notebook quite short and I feel it is missing a kind of ocean-related objective. What I’ve 
been doing is notebooks for a given storm, going from a waveform within the storm (vs out of it) to L4 
SWH though L2, L2P and L3, trying to use a recent event (could be e.g. Hurricane Larry lately ; I did a 
Typhoon Surigae in April, etc.). If you want a clear difference between a calm sea and a rough one on 
waveforms, a strong storm make the thing more obvious, but then you have to be very selective with 
your data. However, since you most often have at least one or two persons in the training audience who 
are interested in SWH, I felt I was providing them with the information they need, too, with this storm 
notebook.
 
If you choose a Gulf-Stream track going over a winter storm (which shouldn’t be that hard to find, and 
could be renewed every year, more or less), you could use the same file all along for S3, I suppose. But 
not any file. 
Best,
Vinca

Hi both,
 
Ocean code in general is here: https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eo-lab-usc-open/ocean 
 
You’ll see all the modules. They are gathered in to one complete set under 
https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eo-lab-usc-open/ocean/eumetsat_ocean_training (set as submodules, so not 
duplicated). There’s still quite a bit of tidying to do, but I’m chipping away at it as I find spare minutes.
 
Vinca – I’ve attached the learn-sral module, which has three scripts, which I believe were yours originally, 
formats etc have been changed a bit. I recently updated the default file, so I could use script on the 
tracks for another demo…but I see now that doesn’t quite work for the scripts on SLA and waveforms as 
you look at specific regions, so we’ll probably need to select another. No problem, I was just using 
examples that could work on wekeo too. The S3 data is accessible via notebook 2, and so is not saved in 
the git repo. The Jason data is there for now, we’ll need to think about integrating that a bit more in to 
the access notebook. Don’t worry about that for now.
 
The idea would be to create an equivalent for the S6 altimetry, so we’d need to do S6 specific versions of 
the 5 notebooks. 1 is just descriptive, you can do it if you like, but it’s also fine for me to do it. The 2nd 
one on access will need to be different, and we may well want to wait as the data access is going to 
change as we finish commissioning and our new data services roll out. So I think if you come up with S6 
equivalents of notebooks 3-5 that would be great. The other bits (readme etc) you can update for S6 if 
you like, but I can also do that when I push your new content to git.
 
Any questions, just let me know. 
 
Best wishes,
 
Hayley

For the Eumetsat internal gitlab: not that I know. I do have access to Confluence but I don’t think 
anything else. 
OK, I can do that – Do I take the current SRAL ones as general guidelines?

Hi both,
 
I think it would be fine just to start with 3 equivalent(ish) notebooks for what we have for SRAL. This 
would add nicely to our set of instrument specific modules we’re organising. 
 
Vinca – do you have access to the internal gitlab? If not I can get it for you, or alternatively you can just 
send me scripts and I will integrate them there for you.

Dear Christine,
 
It depends a bit on your ambition, topics, and public aimed, I’d say. 
At least re-doing the existing S3 ones is a necessity (format is noticeably different, and the S3 code won’t 
read the S6 data). Then… we could expand and propose other, more advanced or specialized, things.

Vinca
